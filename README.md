Welcome to the frontend part of our file management project, utilizing the MERN stack with NEXT-TS.

This project forms a critical component of our comprehensive MERN stack application, enabling users to manage their files seamlessly. Users can create accounts and upload album files, whether single or multiple, with ease. Leveraging technologies like Multer for file uploading and Sharp for compression, files are optimized and converted to WebP format on the backend, ensuring efficient storage and delivery. Additionally, files are uploaded to Cloudinary for storage, further enhancing scalability and accessibility.

Key features include the ability to upload multiple images to create galleries within albums, as well as the option to provide custom names for albums, enhancing organization and usability.
